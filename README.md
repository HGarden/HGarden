### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m currently studying Front-End development at Noroff - School of technology and digital media
- My current interests are music, music production, video games and webdevelopment!
- You can reach me on: https://www.linkedin.com/in/marius-hagen-b997a5234/
- Iâ€™m currently not looking to collaborate, but any constructive critisism is welcome :)
- Fun fact: I like to collect, specifically old videogames and consoles and also music stuff like vinyls and music gear.
